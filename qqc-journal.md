# UNDER CONSTRUCTION: 
For current [rules on H195 QQCR submissions](https://edstem.org/us/courses/66531/discussion/5269602) see the Ed post linked while this webpage is worked on.

# H195 QQCRs

**This assignment is only for CS H195 students.** For the CS 195 version of this assignment, see the [QQCR page]({{site.baseurl}}/qqcr).

Similar to CS 195 students, CS H195 students must do weekly QQCRs (Questions, Quotes, Comments, Replies) on Recommended and Required articles weekly. 

## QQCR Location

To start, create and share a Google document with the instructors, and submit it via the bCourses assignment. This should be done during the first class.

* To make things easier here is a Google doc template. Clicking on [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hnrH7fPt_22b1v-fYKI6VQjNbjzsvmBBoxuAIW8VMdk/copy){: target="_blank"} will prompt you to make a copy of the Google doc. Be sure to make one such that it is shared with your UC Berkeley account.
* Google doc name: “CS H195 QQC Doc: Given_name Surname” – replace Given_name Surname with your name such that it can be matched to your name in the gradebook.

* Contents for each class:
  * Header for each class date with format "Heading 1" so it appears in the document outline.
  * Contents for each reading due by this Discussion date:
    * Citation – Must contain title, author, and year
    * Link to the reading (optional, if useful to you).
    * Your three QQCs about the reading. See below for details.
  * Additional journal entries, if any, for the week. Title the journal entry with format "Heading 2". For example, in the first class you will title it "Goals".

## QQC
QQC stands for Question, Quote, or Comment. The QQC assignment is a short weekly assignment to help you reflect on the readings and contribute to the upcoming class discussion.

**Before class each week**, make a new entry in your QQC Journal. This involves submitting one Quote from the reading and two QQCs per assigned reading. A QQC can be a question about the reading, a quote from the reading, or a comment/reaction to a particular part of the reading. For the assignment itself, you do not need to submit one of each in the submission—as long as one of your three is a quote, you can use any mix.

## Grading
To receive full credit:
* Within the first class meeting, the document exists and is shared with instructors; the document also is submitted through bCourses.
* Format is such that there is a "Heading 1" for each class.
* Three QQCs exist for each reading, where at least one is a quote. Graded on completion.
* All additional journal entries exist as a "Header 2" under the corresponding class. Graded on completion.

This document will be graded periodically throughout the semester by instructors.

**Regrade/Late policy**: Regrade windows will be opened twice during the semester (around Week 7 and during RRR week). During this period, you may review/update your QQCR(s), but you must email the instructor of any specific resubmission(s) so they can regrade your work.
