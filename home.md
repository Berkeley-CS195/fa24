<i>"It's a good thing I'm not evil."</i>

I overheard a lecturer saying this just earlier today. I laughed because it was funny. I had had the same thought myself before. But it's also sobering to think about. There's nothing about me that means I should have more power and the ability to cause harm than the next person, but yet, I do. 

Even ignoring any economic benefits it may provide, understanding how computers work gives one a surprising degree of power with little oversight. What we were talking about when that comment was made was how others had programmed a bot to grab spots on a class waitlist as soon as someone dropped. [unfinished]
